__v.Forth 1.413e__ 

__build 20190311 - Matteo Vitturi, 1990-2019__

In spring of 1990 I had the chance to work for a couple of months on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K equipped with a Microdrive. 
Among the other things, I succeeded to disassemble an reassemble the machine code of a Forth for Spectrum 
Oasis Software's __"White Lightning"__ (https://sites.google.com/view/vforth/wl-dis).

My purpose was to make effective the use of the Microdrive within the Forth environment. 

The result has been satisfying, but due to the fragility of the keyboard, I had to move to emulators that supported Microdrivers.
